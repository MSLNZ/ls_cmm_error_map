# cmm-error-map

An app to allow the user to adjust the 21 components of a CMM error map and visualise the effect each component or combination of components has on the overall measurement volume and on  measurements of specific artefacts (ball-plate and gauge block set).

This will help with using the ball-plate and gauge blocks to assess the CMM uncertainty.It could also  be used as a teaching tool.
